# Site Purpose and Functionality

## Introduction

Adron's Core Platform is a multi-tenant application management system designed to streamline the administration of multiple web applications and their users. This platform serves as a central hub for managing access control, user permissions, and application resources across different organizational boundaries (tenants).

## Core Purpose

### Multi-tenant Application Management
The platform's primary purpose is to provide a robust infrastructure for managing multiple web applications in a multi-tenant environment. This means:
- Each tenant (organization) can have its own set of applications
- Applications can be shared across tenants when needed
- Resources and data are properly isolated between tenants
- Configuration and settings can be customized per tenant

### User Management and Access Control
A key function of the platform is to provide sophisticated user management capabilities:
- Centralized user authentication and authorization
- Role-based access control (RBAC) at both global and tenant levels
- Fine-grained permission management
- User profile and preference management
- Cross-tenant user access when required

### Security and Compliance
The platform is built with security at its core:
- Secure authentication mechanisms
- Data isolation between tenants
- Audit logging of important actions
- Compliance with security best practices
- Protection against common web vulnerabilities
